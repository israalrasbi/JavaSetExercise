Given an array of integers, find all unique triplets that add up to zero. The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]
Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]

Explanation:

The valid triplets that sum to zero are:

[-1, -1, 2] (from two occurrences of -1 and 2)

[-1, 0, 1] (from -1, 0, and 1)

The triplet [1, 0, -1] is not included since it's a duplicate of [-1, 0, 1].s
