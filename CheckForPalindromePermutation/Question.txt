Given a string, determine if any permutation of the string could form a palindrome. Ignore spaces and consider only alphanumeric characters.



Input: s = "taco cat"
Output: true
Input: s = "racecar"
Output: true
Input: s = "hello"
Output: false
Explanation:

For "taco cat", you can rearrange the letters to form "tacocat", which is a palindrome.

"racecar" is already a palindrome.

For "hello", you cannot form a palindrome because it contains too many characters with odd frequencies (h, e, l, o).

Thus, the output is true for the first two inputs and false for the last.


Hint: Use a HashSet to track characters that appear an odd number of times. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count.
