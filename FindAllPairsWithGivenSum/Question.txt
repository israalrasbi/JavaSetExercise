Given an array of integers and a positive integer k, slide a "window" of size k over the array from left to right. For each position of this window, count the number of distinct elements inside the window and store these counts in a result list.

Input: arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4 Output: [3, 4, 4, 3]

Explanation: The windows and their distinct element counts are:

[1, 2, 1, 3] → 3 distinct elements: [1, 2, 3]

[2, 1, 3, 4] → 4 distinct elements: [1, 2, 3, 4]

[1, 3, 4, 2] → 4 distinct elements: [1, 3, 4, 2]

[3, 4, 2, 3] → 3 distinct elements: [3, 4, 2]
